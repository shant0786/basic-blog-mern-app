# basic-blog-mern-app
This basic blog app, built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), allows users to create and view blog posts. The backend handles data with Express and MongoDB, while the React frontend provides an interactive interface. Itâ€™s a simple demonstration of a full-stack web application.
